Testcase 3 fails:
High error, probably because of the lack of accuracy on the sleep function.

Testcase 4 fails:
Limitation of the function to deal with a time equal or higher than 1s; 
the test shows that when the result is slightly lower than 1 the problem happens too.
The probable cause is the lack of accuracy on the sleep function.

Testcase 5 fails:
bug: in some cases, the memory is restarted making the time negative;
a partial solution is set the time to 0 when it happens. It does not impair too much the performance because the updates follow the time, so time equals 0 means no update in the calculations.
